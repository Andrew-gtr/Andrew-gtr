- 👋 Hi, I’m Andrew (@Andrew-gtr)
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and becoming a professional web-developer. I'm also interested in camping and music (playing guitar specifically). The reason this is applicable to this site is simple, these are areas I would love to write code for. For example, I am starting to develop a social media site for musicians called 'The Musician's Forum'. I would also love to develop websites for various campgrounds and fishing areas looking to increase their overall traffic and visitors.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. More insights about HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript and jquery are always welcome. I've also covered PHP and sqli pretty well, and am currently working on one of the full-stack courses offered by Udemy. Pretty much anything that will give me more control and flexibility over my own programming, and of course increase my job potential. I would also love to start programming games, 3D games specifically.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that fits what I have already mentioned.
- 📫 I can be reached at themusiciansforumonline@gmail.com
